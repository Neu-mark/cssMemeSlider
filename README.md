# CSS Meme Slider

A simple and responsive CSS meme slider that showcases a collection of memes using only HTML and CSS. No JavaScript is requiredâ€”just pure CSS magic!

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The slider adjusts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Pure CSS**: Built entirely with HTML and CSS, demonstrating a creative use of CSS for creating a functional slider.
- **Easy to Customize**: Easily update the images and captions to fit your needs.



## How It Works

The slider uses radio buttons and CSS transitions to switch between slides. Each slide is represented by a `div` element with an `img` and a caption. Control elements are placed outside the slider and use `input` elements of type `radio` to navigate between slides.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neu-mark/cssMemeSlider.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd cssMemeSlider
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to view the slider.

## Customization

1. **Images**: Replace the image sources in the `<img>` tags with your own images.
2. **Captions**: Edit the text inside the `<p>` tags within each `.slide-content` div.
3. **Styles**: Modify the CSS in the `<style>` section to change the appearance of the slider and controls.
